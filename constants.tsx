BY ACCESSING, DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, REGISTERING FOR, OR USING THE APP, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP.

Terms of Service and Community Guidelines
Effective Date: January 10, 2026

IMPORTANT – PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

These Terms of Service and Community Guidelines (the “Agreement”) govern your access to and use of the mobile application and any related services (collectively, the “App” or “Service”) provided by Perfect People (referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”).

By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the App in any way, you agree to be legally bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree with any provision of this Agreement, you must immediately cease all use of the App and uninstall it.

1. Eligibility and Age Requirement
You must be at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, if higher) to create an account or use the App. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that:
- You are at least 18 years old;
- You have the legal right, authority, and capacity to enter into this binding Agreement;
- All information you provide is accurate, complete, and current.
We do not knowingly permit or direct the Service to individuals under 18. If we become aware that a user is under 18, we will promptly terminate the account and may report the matter to appropriate authorities. You agree to immediately report any user you reasonably believe is under 18 via the in-app reporting tools.

2. No Liability for User Interactions or Conduct
The Service is provided solely as a platform for users to connect and communicate. We do not conduct background checks, verify identities, or endorse any users.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY for:
- Any interactions, communications, relationships, or transactions between users (online or offline);
- The conduct, actions, or omissions of any user;
- Any content posted or transmitted by users;
- Any harm, loss, injury, damages, or claims (including personal injury, emotional distress, property damage, death, fraud, or financial loss) arising from your use of the Service or from any in-person meeting with another user.
You use the Service and interact with other users entirely at your own risk. We strongly advise against sharing personal information or meeting strangers in person.

3. Assumption of Risk for In-Person Meetings
We strongly discourage and do not encourage in-person meetings with individuals met through the App. We assume no responsibility or liability whatsoever for any consequences that may arise from such meetings, including but not limited to assault, theft, harassment, fraud, injury, or any other harm. Your decision to meet anyone is voluntary and made solely at your own discretion and peril.

4. Prohibited Content and Conduct
You agree not to post, upload, transmit, share, or otherwise make available through the Service any content or engage in any activity that:
- Contains sexually explicit images, videos, nudity, or descriptions;
- Depicts or constitutes indecent exposure;
- Involves any sexual content, discussion, solicitation, or imagery related to minors (persons under 18 years of age);
- Encourages or facilitates alcohol consumption or tobacco use by individuals under 21 years of age;
- Encourages, promotes, or facilitates the use of illegal drugs, controlled substances, or any harmful substances by any person of any age;
- Promotes, seeks, or glorifies large age-gap relationships in a manner that could reasonably be viewed as exploitative, coercive, or predatory.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in immediate account suspension or permanent termination, content removal, and/or referral to law enforcement.

5. Privacy, Safety, and Personal Information Rules
Protecting your privacy and safety is your responsibility. You agree not to:
- Share, request, or solicit any personal identifying information, including full government name, home/work address, school name/location, workplace details, phone number, email, social media handles, financial information, or similar data;
- Engage in doxxing (publishing or threatening to publish private information about another person without consent, with intent to harass, intimidate, or harm).
Large age gaps are strongly discouraged due to potential power imbalances and risks of exploitation. We reserve the right to remove accounts or content that, in our sole discretion, exploit such dynamics.

6. Reporting Obligations
You must immediately report through the in-app tools:
- Any user reasonably believed to be under 18 years of age;
- Any violation of this Agreement;
- Any content or behavior that makes you feel unsafe, threatened, or harassed.
Failure to report serious violations may compound risks to the community.

7. Safety Warnings and Best Practices
Your safety and well-being are your top priority.
- Do not use the App as a means to escape or cope with an existing abusive, dangerous, or harmful situation — doing so may increase your risk.
- Exercise extreme caution when interacting with others.
- Meet only in public places, if at all; inform a trusted friend of your plans; and trust your instincts.
- When a person shows or tells you who they are through their words, actions, or behavior — believe them the first time.

8. Enforcement, Termination, and Indemnification
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion and without prior notice, to suspend, terminate, or delete any account, remove content, or report suspected illegal activity to law enforcement.
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Service, your violation of this Agreement, or your interactions with other users.

9. Entire Agreement & Governing Law
This Agreement (together with any incorporated Privacy Policy or Community Guidelines) constitutes the entire understanding between you and us regarding the Service and supersedes all prior agreements.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of laws principles.

By continuing to use the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and voluntarily agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety.

Thank you for helping us foster a safe, respectful, and responsible community. If you have questions, contact us through the App's support feature.`;
